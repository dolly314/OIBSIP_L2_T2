            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <h3><b>Ada Lovelace</b>(born on December 26, 1791 -died in October 18, 1871) is an English mathematician, an associate of Charles Babbage, for whose prototype of a digital computer she created a program. She has been called the <i>1st computer programmer</i>.Lovelace was the daughter of famed poet Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke Byron, who legally separated two months after her birth. Her father then left Britain forever, and his daughter never knew him personally. She was educated privately by tutors and then self-educated but was helped in her advanced studies by mathematician-logician Augustus De Morgan, the first professor of mathematics at the University of London. On July 8, 1835, she married William King, 8th Baron King, and, when he was created an earl in 1838, she became countess of Lovelace.Lovelace became interested in Babbage’s machines as early as 1833 when she was introduced to Babbage by their mutual friend, author Mary Somerville, and, most notably, in 1843 came to translate and annotate an article written by the Italian mathematician and engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea, “Notions sur la machine analytique de Charles Babbage” (1842; “Elements of Charles Babbage’s Analytical Machine”). Her detailed and elaborate annotations (especially her description of how the proposed Analytical Engine could be programmed to compute Bernoulli numbers) were excellent; “the Analytical Engine,” she said, “weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves.”Babbage only built a small part of the Analytical Engine, but Lovelace’s efforts have been remembered. The early programming language Ada was named for her, and the second Tuesday in October has become Ada Lovelace Day, on which the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are honoured.</h3>

            <h1>Discovery</h1>
            <h3><i>First Computer Program</i><br>In June 1833, Lovelace was introduced to Charles Babbage through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month, Babbage showed Lovelace his prototype for his Difference engine. She was fascinated with the machine, and Babbage was impressed by Lovelace’s intellect and analytical skills. He called her “The Enchantress of Number.” In 1840 Babbage was giving a seminar about his Analytical Engine at the University of Turn. Luigi Menagrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed the lecture into French. His transcription was published in October 1842, and Ada Lovelace translated this paper into English. She translated the paper and added notes. Ada Lovelace spent about a year doing this, and the notes were more extensive than the paper. Her notes were labeled alphabetically from A to G. In note G she outlined an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. This is to be considered the first published algorithm, and Ada Lovelace is quoted as the first computer programmer for this reason. The engine was never completed, so her program was never tested. It was published in the Taylor’s Scientific Memoirs under the Initials AAL in September 1843. Once the papers were published Lovelace and Babbage had a falling out. Babbage tried to leave his statement as an unsigned preface. Leaving it unsigned would make his statement and Lovelace’s look like a joint effort. Babbage asked Lovelace to withdraw the paper, and she refused. Their friendship did recover. In 1953 Ada Lovelace’s notes on Babbage’s Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B.V. Bowden’s “Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines.” The engine is recognized as an early model for a computer. Ada’s notes are seen as a description of a computer and software. In her notes, Lovelace also emphasized the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines. </h3>

            <h1>Distinction between mechanism and logical structure</h1>
            <h3>Lovelace recognized the difference between the details of the computing mechanism, as covered in an 1834 article on the Difference Engine,[83] and the logical structure of the Analytical Engine, on which the article she was reviewing dwelt. She noted that different specialists might be required in each area.<br>The [1834 article] chiefly treats it under its mechanical aspect, entering but slightly into the mathematical principles of which that engine is the representative, but giving, in considerable length, many details of the mechanism and contrivances by means of which it tabulates the various orders of differences. M. Menabrea, on the contrary, exclusively developes the analytical view; taking it for granted that mechanism is able to perform certain processes, but without attempting to explain how; and devoting his whole attention to explanations and illustrations of the manner in which analytical laws can be so arranged and combined as to bring every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the assumed powers of mechanism. It is obvious that, in the invention of a calculating engine, these two branches of the subject are equally essential fields of investigation... They are indissolubly connected, though so different in their intrinsic nature, that perhaps the same mind might not be likely to prove equally profound or successful in both.</h3>

          <h1>Controversy over contribution</h1>
          <h3>Though Lovelace is often referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing suggest otherwise.Allan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines:<br>All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a "bug" in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.Doron Swade has said that Ada only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it, but agrees that she was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.<br>In his book, Idea Makers, Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelace's contributions. While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace's notes, Wolfram argues that "there's nothing as sophisticated—or as clean—as Ada's computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it." Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence "a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine—something which Babbage never did".</h3>

            <h1>Commemoration</h1>
            <h3>The computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace. The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth.<br>In 1981, the Association for Women in Computing inaugurated its Ada Lovelace Award. As of 1998, the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal, and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students. BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women undergraduates. Ada College is a further-education college in Tottenham Hale, London, focused on digital skills.<br>In March 2022, a statue of Ada Lovelace was installed at the site of the former Ergon House in the City of Westminster, London, honoring its scientific history. The redevelopment was part of a complex with Imperial Chemical House. The statue was sculpted by Etienne and Mary Millner and based on the portrait by Margaret Sarah Carpenter. The sculpture was unveiled on International Women's Day, 2022. It stands on the 7th floor of Millbank Quarter overlooking the junction of Dean Bradley Street and Horseferry Road.<br>In September 2022, Nvidia announced the Ada Lovelace graphics processing unit (GPU) microarchitecture.<br>In July 2023, The UK's Royal Mint issued four commemorative £2 coins in various metals to "honour the innovative contributions of computer science visionary Ada Lovelace and her legacy as a female trailblazer."</h3>
